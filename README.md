## Financial Distress Prediction 

### Problem statement
Credit scoring algorithms, which make a guess at the probability of default, are the method banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted. 
This project requires Learners to improve on the state of the art in credit scoring, by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years.
